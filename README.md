## 🧠 Using n8n Workflows for AI Applications

You can use n8n to build AI-powered workflows that interact with Ollama and other services. Here’s how you typically provide input and get output:

### 1. Input Methods

- **Manual Trigger:** Start the workflow manually in the n8n UI and provide input via UI fields or parameters.
- **Webhook Trigger:** Expose an HTTP endpoint (Webhook node) that accepts POST requests. Send data (e.g., text, JSON) to this endpoint from your app, script, or another service.
- **Schedule Trigger:** Run workflows on a schedule (e.g., every hour) to process data automatically.
- **Other Triggers:** Use Email, File, or other trigger nodes to start workflows based on events.

### 2. Processing with AI

- Add an **Ollama node** or **HTTP Request node** to your workflow.
- Pass the input (e.g., prompt, document, question) to the Ollama node or API endpoint.
- Configure the node to use the desired model (e.g., `llama3`).

### 3. Getting Output

- The output from Ollama (AI response) is available as the output of the node.
- You can:
   - Return it directly via a Webhook Response node (for API-style workflows)
   - Send it via Email, Slack, or other integrations
   - Store it in a database or file
   - Use it in further workflow steps (e.g., parsing, decision-making)

### Example: Simple Webhook AI Chat

1. Add a **Webhook** node (set to POST, e.g., `/ai-chat`).
2. Add an **Ollama** node (or HTTP Request node to `http://ollama:11434/api/generate`).
3. Map the incoming data (e.g., `{{$json["prompt"]}}`) to the Ollama node’s prompt field.
4. Add a **Webhook Response** node to return the AI’s answer.

**How it works:**
- Send a POST request to `http://localhost:5678/webhook/ai-chat` with `{ "prompt": "Your question here" }`.
- The workflow sends the prompt to Ollama, gets the response, and returns it to you.

> [!NOTE]
> You can trigger workflows from your app, scripts, or even the browser. n8n makes it easy to connect inputs and outputs to any service.

```

> [!NOTE]
> If you have not used your Nvidia GPU with Docker before, you must follow the steps above to install the NVIDIA Container Toolkit. For more, see the [Ollama Docker instructions](https://hub.docker.com/r/ollama/ollama).

## 🧩 Model Management

### Managing Models in Ollama

Ollama lets you add, remove, and list models using its CLI or API. Common commands:

- **List models:**
   ```bash
   ollama list
   ```
- **Pull a model:**
   ```bash
   ollama pull llama3
   ```
- **Remove a model:**
   ```bash
   ollama rm llama3
   ```
- **More info:** See the [Ollama documentation](https://ollama.com/docs/models) for details on managing models, custom models, and advanced usage.

### Using Models in n8n

n8n connects to Ollama and lets you select which model to use in the Ollama node. To change the model:

1. Open your workflow in n8n.
2. Edit the Ollama node and set the "Model" field to the desired model name (e.g., `llama3`, `mistral`, etc.).
3. Make sure the model is available in your Ollama instance (see above).

For more, see the [n8n AI documentation](https://docs.n8n.io/advanced-ai/) and [Ollama node docs](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/root-nodes/n8n-nodes-ollama/).

### For AMD GPU users on Linux

```bash
git clone https://github.com/n8n-io/self-hosted-ai-starter-kit.git
cd self-hosted-ai-starter-kit
cp .env.example .env # you should update secrets and passwords inside
docker compose --profile gpu-amd up
```

#### For Mac / Apple Silicon users

If you’re using a Mac with an M1 or newer processor, you can't expose your GPU
to the Docker instance, unfortunately. There are two options in this case:

1. Run the starter kit fully on CPU, like in the section "For everyone else"
   below
2. Run Ollama on your Mac for faster inference, and connect to that from the
   n8n instance

If you want to run Ollama on your mac, check the
[Ollama homepage](https://ollama.com/)
for installation instructions, and run the starter kit as follows:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/n8n-io/self-hosted-ai-starter-kit.git
cd self-hosted-ai-starter-kit
cp .env.example .env # you should update secrets and passwords inside
docker compose up
```

##### For Mac users running OLLAMA locally

If you're running OLLAMA locally on your Mac (not in Docker), you need to modify the OLLAMA_HOST environment variable

1. Set OLLAMA_HOST to `host.docker.internal:11434` in your .env file. 
2. Additionally, after you see "Editor is now accessible via: <http://localhost:5678/>":

    1. Head to <http://localhost:5678/home/credentials>
    2. Click on "Local Ollama service"
    3. Change the base URL to "http://host.docker.internal:11434/"

#### For everyone else

```bash
git clone https://github.com/n8n-io/self-hosted-ai-starter-kit.git
cd self-hosted-ai-starter-kit
cp .env.example .env # you should update secrets and passwords inside
docker compose --profile cpu up
```

## ⚡️ Quick start and usage

The core of the Self-hosted AI Starter Kit is a Docker Compose file, pre-configured with network and storage settings, minimizing the need for additional installations.
After completing the installation steps above, simply follow the steps below to get started.

1. Open <http://localhost:5678/> in your browser to set up n8n. You’ll only
   have to do this once.
2. Open the included workflow:
   <http://localhost:5678/workflow/srOnR8PAY3u4RSwb>
3. Click the **Chat** button at the bottom of the canvas, to start running the workflow.
4. If this is the first time you’re running the workflow, you may need to wait
   until Ollama finishes downloading Llama3.2. You can inspect the docker
   console logs to check on the progress.

To open n8n at any time, visit <http://localhost:5678/> in your browser.

With your n8n instance, you’ll have access to over 400 integrations and a
suite of basic and advanced AI nodes such as
[AI Agent](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/root-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.agent/),
[Text classifier](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/root-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.text-classifier/),
and [Information Extractor](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/root-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.information-extractor/)
nodes. To keep everything local, just remember to use the Ollama node for your
language model and Qdrant as your vector store.

> [!NOTE]
> This starter kit is designed to help you get started with self-hosted AI
> workflows. While it’s not fully optimized for production environments, it
> combines robust components that work well together for proof-of-concept
> projects. You can customize it to meet your specific needs

## Tips & tricks

### Accessing local files

The self-hosted AI starter kit will create a shared folder (by default,
located in the same directory) which is mounted to the n8n container and
allows n8n to access files on disk. This folder within the n8n container is
located at `/data/shared` -- this is the path you’ll need to use in nodes that
interact with the local filesystem.
